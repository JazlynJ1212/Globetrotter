### Reflection

* Did the topics discussed in your labs prepare you to complete the assignment? Be specific, which features in your weekly assignment did you feel unprepared to complete?
      Yes, the topics discussed in lab helped tremendously. The campus life starter helped to properly format the "skeleton" of the project. Since I did not fully complete the labs
  I felt unprepared to complete the personal stylizations of different website features such as full customization of the navigation bar and
  styling the picture containers.
  

* If you had more time, what would you have done differently? Would you have added additional features? Changed the way your project responded to a particular event, etc.

  If I had more time I would hone into the typography and use complementary sarif and non-sarif fonts throughout to give the site a change of pace. I would also include a media query that changed the navigation into a
  hamburger menu for mobile screen sizes.  

* Reflect on your project demo, what went well? Were there things that maybe didn't go as planned? Did you notice something that your peer did that you would like to try next time?

  My project demo went well, I was able to successfully display my project. I noticed how my peers used gifs in their banner and included unique colorways which I will implement next time.
